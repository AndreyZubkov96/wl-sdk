/**
 * This endpoint gets information about a client profile. Alternatively, this endpoint can also edit or create a profile.
 *
 * The GET method returns the profile fields for a specified user or a blank set of fields for a new user of a
 * given business:
 *
 * * If the GET method is used with a valid UID greater than 0, the method will return a list of fields with the
 *   values of the specified user.
 * * If the GET method is used with a UID set to 0, a list of profile fields will be returned for the specified
 *   business. A user in WellnessLiving can be in multiple businesses. There are some fields common among all business
 *   and others specific to one business.
 *
 * The type of field is described in `id_field_type`, which will be one of the {@link WlFieldTypeSid} constants.
 * Some fields have a general type which can have a specific format:
 * * Address - An array containing the following keys: `k_city`, `s_address`, `s_city`, and `s_postal`.
 * The `k_city` value can be retrieved via the {@link \WellnessLiving\Core\Geo\ComboboxModel} endpoint. The following is an example address array:
 *
 *   <pre>
 *     $o_edit_model->a_change[13] = [
 *       'k_city' => '4934', // Toronto's k_city value.
 *       's_address' => 'Canada',
 *       's_city' => 'Toronto, ON, Canada',
 *       's_postal' => 'M5X1E5'
 *     ];
 *   </pre>
 *
 * * Birthday -  A string containing the date in MySQL format (for example, `1987-06-05`).
 * * Email Address - An array containing the following keys:
 * <dl>
 *   <dt>bool <var>is_inherit</var></dt>
 *   <dd>Whether the user shares the email address with another user.
 *   This is typically done for children who use their parentâ€™s email (is_inherit=1).
 *   In general, most other cases use (is_inherit=0).</dd>
 *   <dt>bool <var>s_mail</var></dt>
 *   <dd>The new email address.</dd>
 * </dl>
